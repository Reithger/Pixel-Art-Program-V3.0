# Pixel-Art-Program-V3.0
 Here we go, making the third and superior version of this program for wider and more expansive uses. Might take a while, but I really want to make this. It's an art program focused around small pixelated images, but new developments should actually allow it to do regular art, too (supposing I program it correctly).
